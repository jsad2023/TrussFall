%Preliminary Truss Analysis

%% Step 1 - Set Up Variables

%Connection Matrix C

%Row rreps joint # and col is member #
%In example Truss there are 5 joints and 7 members. 5-joint/7-member truss.
%5j/7m
% Hence in C,  5 rows and 7 cols
% sum of each column should only be 2 as each member is only connected to 
%two joints
% sum of each row  should be # of members attached
%to corresponding joint
%Indicate a connection of member 1 to joints 1 and 2 by placing a 1 at
%(1,1) & (2,1)
