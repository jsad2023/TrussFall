# TrussFall
Truss Fall github
A repository for all members of truss fall to view and edit our code for data analysis

Alternate names: 
  Straw Brawls,
  Never Truss a Husky,
  The Truss Terriers,
  
 Notes to self:
***Both GetMaxLoad.m and getBuckling need to be edited to adjust to the new uncertainity analysis shown
in the Final version of the Truss Manual***
 
Maybe functions are_values_correct and are_values_valid should be put in the main script
Buckling  == max load for given length (on class data from blackboard
Cost == Eqn on pg. 4
Print results need to be updated to include theoritical max load and cost
